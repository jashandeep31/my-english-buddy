                    <h2>Q: Is learning English difficult?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To start with - No. English is actually an easy language
                        to begin learning because: it has no genders. Apart from
                        people, all objects are 'neuter', not 'masculine' or
                        'feminine'. So you say 'it' for such things, and do not
                        need to learn any genders for objects. it usually has
                        easy verb endings. Apart from a few 'irregular' verbs,
                        verb endings are easy, and hardly change. adjectives
                        remain the same for all words - there are no different
                        endings to learn. the singular and plural pronoun 'you'
                        is the same. There is no need to decide whether to use a
                        polite form, or an intimate form.

                    <h2>Q: Do I have to learn English grammar?</h2>
                    <p>
                        While there's no "have to" when it comes to learning
                        English grammar, it's important to incorporate it into
                        your learning program in order to progress beyond basic
                        proficiency. Starting with building your vocabulary and
                        speaking is key, but as you advance, correct grammar
                        becomes more important. Although learning grammar may
                        seem daunting, English grammar is actually easier than
                        many other languages. Remember that grammar is the
                        mortar that holds the bricks of vocabulary together, and
                        mastering it is essential for natural fluency.

                    <h2>Q: Why is it important to take an English course?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Knowing English increases your chances of getting a good
                        job in a multinational company within your home country
                        or for finding work abroad. It's also the language of
                        international communication, the media and the internet,
                        so learning English is important for socialising and
                        entertainment as well as work!

                        Q: Learning English gives you Access to more of the
                        Internet?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        According to a report by Education First, English is the
                        language of the internet. An estimated 565 million
                        people use the internet every day, and an estimated 52
                        percent of the world’s most visited websites are
                        displayed in the English language. Learning English is
                        important as it gives you access to over half the
                        content on the internet. Knowing how to read English
                        will allow you access to billions of pages of
                        information which may not be otherwise available!
